Data taken of the 18x24" surface plate on 2024-12-18

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Samples were taken on a 50mm x 50mm grid

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The level was configured on the adjustable XY base

 (0, 0)        (94.90, 0)

The origin foot at (0, 0) is 23.92mm in diameter with a 1.90mm thick wall
The X at (94.90, 0) is 23.91mm in diameter with a 1.90mm thick wall
The Y at (0, 100.00) is 23.92mm in diameter with a 1.89mm thick wall

The first file contains all 54 points from the bottom left to the top right of
the plate. Measurements were doing with the 0,0 foot of the level on the given
grid coord.

The next 2 files contain samples from the "top right" to the "bottom left" with
the level rotated 180 degrees on the XY plane.
Measurements were doing with the 0,0 foot of the level on the given grid coord.
